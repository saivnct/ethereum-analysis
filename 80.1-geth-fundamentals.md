# Go-Ethereum Fundamentals

## 1. Networking security

- The local machine's firewall settings should:

  - Block all traffic to 8545, or whatever custom port has been defined for JSON-RPC requests to the node, except for traffic from explicitly defined trusted machines.
  - Allow traffic on TCP 30303 or whichever custom port has been defined for peer-to-peer communications. This allows the node to connect to peers.
  - Allow traffic on UDP 30303 or whichever custom port has been defined for peer-to-peer communications. This allows node discovery.

## 2. Databases

- Since v1.9.0, Geth has divided its database into two parts. Recent blocks and state data are kept in **quick-access storage**, but older blocks and receipts (**"ancients"**) are stored in a **"freezer" database**.
- The point of this separation is to minimize the dependency on expensive, sensitive SSDs, and instead push the less frequently-accessed data into a database that can be supported by cheaper and more durable drives.
- Storing less data in the faster LevelDB database also enables faster compactions and improves the database performance by allowing more state trie nodes to be held in active memory for a given cache-size.

### a. Recent blocks

- Geth stores recent blocks in a LevelDB database. This is a persistent key-value store that can be queried very quickly.
- The LevelDB database is supposed to be run on top of a fast SSD hard disk so that the disk IO is not bottlenecked by the underlying hardware.
- In addition to basic storage, the LevelDB database supports batch writes and iterations over the keyspace in binary-alphabetical order.
- The database is periodically compacted to reduce the operational cost of accessing indivdual items. This is achieved by flattening the underlying data store for a given range of keys. Any deleted or overwritten items in that key range are removed and the surviving data is reorganized for efficiency.

### b. Freezer/ancients

- Older segments of the chain are moved out of the LevelDB database and into a freezer database.
- Nodes rarely need to access these files so IO speed is less important and the bulk of the chain data can be stored on a cheaper HDD.
- Once blocks pass some threshold age (90,000 blocks behind the head by default) the block and receipt data is flattened and saved as a raw binary blob of data along with an index entry file used for identification.
- The ancients data is saved entirely separately from the fast-access recent data, meaning **it can be stored in a different location**.
- The default location for the ancient chain segments is inside the chaindata directory, which is inside datadir, but it can be defined by passing **--datadir.ancient <path>** to Geth on startup.
- The freezer is designed to have a read operation complexity of O(1), involving only a read for index items (6 bytes) and a read for the data. This design makes the freezer performant enough to run on a slow HDD disk, permitting people to run Ethereum nodes without requiring a huge SSD. The ancient data can also be moved later by manually copying the directory to a new location and then starting Geth passing the new path to **--datadir.ancient**.

### c. Freezer/ancients

- If Geth cannot find the freezer, either because the database was deleted or because Geth received an incorrect path, then the node becomes unstable => **It is explicitly forbidden to start Geth with an invalid path to the freezer**.
- If the state database goes missing Geth can rebuild all its indices based upon data from the freezer and then do a snap-sync on top of it to fill in the missing state data:

  - This can be used to deliberately clean up a node.
  - Passing **--datadir --removedb** starts the process.
    > geth removedb --datadir node4
  - Geth will ask whether it should delete the state database, the ancient database and the LES database.
  - Choosing to delete the state database only leaves the block bodies, receipts, headers etc intact in the freezer, meaning rebuilding the state will not include re-downloading ~400GB of data from the network.
  - Geth will then rebuild the state from the freezer reusing that existing block and receipt data.
  - In doing so, unused data and accumulated junk data will be pruned from the state database.
  - This process can take an hour or more.

## 3. Unclean shutdowns

- If Geth stops unexpectedly the database can be corrupted. This is known as an "**unclean shutdown"** and it can lead to a variety of problems for the node when it is restarted.
- It is always best to shut down Geth gracefully, i.e. using a shutdown command such as **ctrl-c**, **docker stop -t 300 <container ID>** or **systemctl stop** (although please note that systemctl stop has a default timeout of 90s - if Geth takes longer than this to gracefully shut down it will quit forcefully. Update the TimeoutSecs variable in systemd.service to override this value to something larger, at least 300s).

  - This way, Geth knows to write all relevant information into the database to allow the node to restart properly later.
  - This can involve >1GB of information being written to the LevelDB database which can take several minutes.

- If an unexpected shutdown does occur, the **removedb** subcommand can be used to delete the state database and resync it from the ancient database. This should get the database back up and running.

## 4. Blockchain Import/Export

- Export the blockchain in binary format with:

  > geth export \<filename>

- Or if you want to back up portions of the chain over time, a first and last block can be specified. For example, to back up the first epoch:

  > geth export \<filename> 0 29999

- Note that when backing up a partial chain, the file will be appended rather than truncated.

- Import binary-format blockchain exports with:

  > geth import \<filename>
