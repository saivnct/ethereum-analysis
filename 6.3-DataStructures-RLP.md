# **Data Structure And Encoding - Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) Encoding/Decoding**

## **1. Recursive Length Prefix (RLP)**

- RLP is an encoding/decoding algorithm that helps Ethereum to serialize data and possible to reconstruct them quickly.

## **1. RLP Encoding**

- RLP encoding function takes in an item
- An item is defined as follows

  - A string (will be converted to byte array) is an item
  - A list of items is an item

  > For example, all of objects below are items:
  >
  > - “dog”
  > - []
  > - [“dog”]
  > - [[], “dog”, [“cat”], “ ”]

### **a. RLD encoding rules**:

- 1. If input is a single byte in the **_(0x00, 0x7f]_** range _(in decimal (0, 127])_, so **itself** is RLP encoding.
- 2. If input is non-value **_(uint(0), []byte{}, string(“”), empty pointer …)_**, RLP encoding is **0x80**. Notice that **0x00** value byte is not non-value.
- 3. If input is a special byte in **_[0x80, 0xff]_** range _(in decimal [128, 255])_, RLP encoding will **concatenates 0x81 with the byte** => **_[0x81, the_byte]_**.
- 4. If input is **a string with 2–55 bytes long**, RLP encoding consists of a single byte with value **0x80 plus the length of the string in bytes and then array of hex value of string** => It’s easy to see that the first byte is in **_[0x82, 0xb7]_** range _(in decimal [130, 183])_.

  > <br>For example:<br> > **“hello world” = [0x8b, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x20, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64]**

  > - Because “hello world” has 11 bytes length in dec or 0x0b in hex
  > - The first byte of RLP encoding is **0x80 + 0x0b = 0x8b** , after that we concatenate the bytes of “hello word”.<br><br>

- 5. If input is a string with **more than 55 bytes long**, RLP encoding consists of 3 parts from the left to the right:

  - **The first part** is a single byte with value **0xb7 plus the length in bytes of the second part**.
  - **The second part** is **hex value of the length** of the string
  - **The last one** is the **string in bytes**

  > <br>For example:
  >
  > - Assuming that we have a string with 1024 “a” characters => “aaa…”<br>
  >   “aaaa...” = [**0xb9, 0x04, 0x00**, 0x61, 0x61, 0x61, 0x61, ...]
  > - Because “aaaa...” has 1024 bytes length in dec or 0x0400 in hex
  > - The 2nd part of RLP encoding is **[0x04, 0x00]** => with 2 bytes length in dec or 0x2 in hex
  > - The 1st part of RLP encoding is **0xb7 + 0x02 = 0xb9**
  > - The 3rd part is the whole string in byte array<br><br>

- 6. If input is an **_empty array_**, RLP encoding is a **_single byte 0xc0_**
- 7. If input is **_a list with total payload in 0–55 bytes long_**, RLP encoding consists of a single byte with value **_0xc0 plus total length of the list's RLP payload_** and then the **_concatenation of RLP encodings of the items in list_** => The range of the first byte is [0xc1, 0xf7] _(in decimal [193, 247])_

  > <br>For example:<br>
  >
  > - “hello”, RLP encoding: [0x85, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f] => length = 6 bytes (0x06)
  > - "world", RLP encoding: [0x85, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64] => length = 6 bytes (0x06)
  > - total RLP payload = 12 (0x06 + 0x06 = 0x0c)
  > - 1st byte: 0xc0 + 0x0c = 0xcc<br> > **[“hello”, “world”] = [0xcc, 0x85, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x85, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64]**<br><br>
